If the recipe lists 5 minutes in a 1000W microwave, and you have an 800W
microwave, how long to you cook the damn thing for?

Answer: good thing it's only watts, you can use division.

T = (rm / ym) * t

where t is the listed time in seconds, rm is the recipie microwave power, ym is
your microwave's power.
